# Decorator Design Pattern

The Decorator Design Pattern is a structural pattern that attaches additional responsibilities or behaviors to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality by wrapping the original object in an object of a decorator class. This pattern adheres to the Open/Closed Principle, enabling you to extend an object's behavior without modifying its source code.

## Key Concepts of the Decorator Pattern

1. **Component:** An interface or abstract class that defines the operations that can be dynamically augmented.
2. **Concrete Component:** The original object to which additional functionality is added.
3. **Decorator:** An abstract class that implements the component interface and holds a reference to a component object. It forwards requests to the component.
4. **Concrete Decorators:** Classes that extend the Decorator to add specific behaviors before or after forwarding the request.

## Structure of the Decorator Pattern

- **Component Interface:** Declares the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added dynamically.
- **Concrete Component:** Implements the component interface. This is the object being decorated.
- **Decorator Base Class:** Implements the component interface and contains a reference to a component object.
- **Concrete Decorators:** Extend the decorator base class and modify or add behavior to the component's operations.

## When to Use the Decorator Pattern

- When you want to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently, without affecting other objects.
- When subclassing would lead to an explosion of classes to support every combination of behaviors.
- When you need to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle by extending an object's behavior without modifying its code.

## Real-Life Example in Software Systems: Notification System

Consider a notification system where messages are sent through various channels (e.g., email, SMS). Instead of creating subclasses for every possible combination (e.g., EmailNotifierWithLogging, SMSNotifierWithEncryption), decorators allow you to add features like logging or encryption dynamically.

### Without Using the Decorator Pattern (Direct Implementation)
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// BasicNotifier sends a simple notification.
type BasicNotifier struct{}

func (bn *BasicNotifier) Send(message string) {
    fmt.Println("Sending notification:", message)
}

func main() {
    notifier := &BasicNotifier{}
    notifier.Send("Hello, World!")
}
```

**Issues:**
- Extending functionality (e.g., logging, encryption) would require modifying or subclassing BasicNotifier, leading to code duplication and an explosion of subclasses.

### With the Decorator Pattern
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Component interface for notifier.
type Notifier interface {
    Send(message string)
}

// Concrete Component: BasicNotifier
type BasicNotifier struct{}

func (bn *BasicNotifier) Send(message string) {
    fmt.Println("Sending notification:", message)
}

// Decorator Base: NotifierDecorator
type NotifierDecorator struct {
    notifier Notifier
}

func (nd *NotifierDecorator) Send(message string) {
    nd.notifier.Send(message)
}

// Concrete Decorator: LoggingDecorator adds logging functionality.
type LoggingDecorator struct {
    NotifierDecorator
}

func (ld *LoggingDecorator) Send(message string) {
    fmt.Println("Logging: About to send message")
    ld.NotifierDecorator.Send(message)
}

// Concrete Decorator: EncryptionDecorator adds encryption functionality.
type EncryptionDecorator struct {
    NotifierDecorator
}

func (ed *EncryptionDecorator) Send(message string) {
    encryptedMessage := "encrypted(" + message + ")"
    ed.NotifierDecorator.Send(encryptedMessage)
}

func main() {
    // Create a basic notifier.
    basicNotifier := &BasicNotifier{}

    // Decorate with logging.
    loggingNotifier := &LoggingDecorator{NotifierDecorator{notifier: basicNotifier}}

    // Further decorate with encryption.
    encryptedLoggingNotifier := &EncryptionDecorator{NotifierDecorator{notifier: loggingNotifier}}

    // Send a notification with combined behaviors.
    encryptedLoggingNotifier.Send("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Advantages of the Decorator Pattern

1. **Dynamic Behavior Addition:** You can add responsibilities to objects at runtime.
2. **Flexibility:** Multiple decorators can be combined in various orders to produce different behavior combinations.
3. **Adherence to Open/Closed Principle:** Extend functionality without modifying existing classes.
4. **Reusability:** Decorators can be reused independently of the core component, promoting modular design.

---

## Disadvantages of the Decorator Pattern

1. **Increased Complexity:** More classes and interfaces are introduced, which can make the design more complex.
2. **Overhead:** Each additional decorator adds an extra layer, which might introduce a slight performance overhead.
3. **Debugging Difficulty:** Tracing behavior through multiple decorator layers can be challenging.

## Real-World Scenario Example: Notification System

Imagine a notification system that must support sending messages through different channels and with additional features such as logging and encryption. Instead of writing multiple classes to cover every combination, you can design individual decorators for each responsibility. This way, you dynamically compose a notifier with the desired functionalities at runtime, simplifying maintenance and extension.

## Conclusion

The Decorator Design Pattern provides a robust mechanism to extend the behavior of objects dynamically without modifying their code. It enhances flexibility and promotes adherence to the Open/Closed Principle, making it a valuable pattern for adding features like logging, encryption, or other cross-cutting concerns in a modular and reusable manner.
